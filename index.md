### Background and Education
I went to [St John's University][My College] for pharmacy. I received Doctor of Pharmacy degree and graduated with summa cum laude. I worked as a retail pharmacist for 12 years.  
  
I'm currently enrolled in **Justice Through Code** program in association with Columbia University. I'm thoroughly enjoying the classes as we learn about writing cover letters, preparing for interviews, and designing websites while learning basic *HTML*, *CSS*, and *Javascript* skills.  

To keep me focused on my path, I'm reminded of this quote by Norman Vincent Peale:
>“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.”
